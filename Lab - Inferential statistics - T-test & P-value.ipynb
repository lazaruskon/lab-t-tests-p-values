Our alternative hypothesis is that our older machine wil present a greatermean distribution due to its slower packing times.\n",

    "Our null hypothesis was that the GPA of the two groups in question (Sophomore and Junior college students) is going to be statistically not different. Alternatively, we hypothesized that it might present a statistically important difference. As a result we collected GPA scores from both groups of students. The null hypothesis supported, thus, the mean distribution of the two groups is the same. Our alternative hypothesis is that the mean distribution of the two groups is the not the same.\n",

    "After running our tests we can conclude that we **do not** have sufficient statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis aka that the mean between the two data groups is different (*p* = 0.36422 for *a* = 0.05). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of this experiment we would conclude that this an interesting result since we may have expected that grades would, in general terms, get better after the inital first year. Further investigation would potentially be useful in order to explore how different the GPA scores of junior and somophore students are (which one is great?) and why (talk to teacher and collect more data from students)."
